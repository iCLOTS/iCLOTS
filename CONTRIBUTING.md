# Contributing Guidelines

Hi! Thanks for being an iCLOTS user. We appreciate all contributions to our software.

iCLOTS has been largely created by the project's lead developer, Meredith E. Fay, a PhD candidate in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Emory University and Georgia Institute of Technology, under the guidance of principal investigator Wilbur A. Lam, MD, PhD.
We are largely self-taught, so appreciate any thoughtful suggestions and feedback on improving iCLOTS.
We would love to create a community of users and developers such that iCLOTS can continue to grow and benefit the bioscience and clinical communities.

We have developed iCLOTS as an open-source, entirely standalone product with users with no computational experience in mind. You can also learn more and contact us at [our project website](https://www.iclots.org/). If you're reporting issues with use with a specific dataset, we appreciate a sample file. Provided data will not be shared outside of the development team.

## Creating an Issue

The iCLOTS team welcomes feedback using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/iCLOTS/iCLOTS/issues). Examples of useful feedback include:

* Additions and corrections to documentation. Where did you find an error? Do you have suggestions to replace the issue you found?
* Errors starting or running iCLOTS. The current version of iCLOTS is a beta version, understood to potentially contain bugs. What is the exact error? How did the error occur?
* Unexpected behavior or output. What happened? How did it occur? What behavior would you like to see?
* New feature or application ideas. What is the suggested change? Why would this functionality help you?

We appreciate issues with descriptive titles and specific information about the issue. 

The development team may contact you about your issue, please be ready to discuss!

## Creating entirely new applications

We would be happy to work new functionalities into iCLOTS! Please contact the development at lamlabcomputational@gmail.com to discuss complexity/package dependencies, usefulness to a broad audience, changes to existing applications, and the iCLOTS team's ability to implement/maintain your ideas.

## Development Environment

iCLOTS has been developed using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). The Community Edition is free and contains all the features needed for easy development.

## Style Guide

All developers write code differently. Please make an effort to follow our general style. We follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

## Getting Started

To submit changes to iCLOTS, you'll need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account with a copy of the iCLOTS repository.
We're new to this too, but have found [First Contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions) to be an excellent guide to contributing to open-source projects.
